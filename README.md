Hi! I'm Cholo Santos Jeolin, a 2nd year student studying Industrial Engineering student at Technological Institute of the Philippines. 

I will focus on learning Python to support data analysis, process optiization, and problem-solving in industrial engineerung. I will explore areas such as automation, statistics, and basic machine leaning to improve decision-making skills. 

My academic journey will help me develop skills in analytical thinking, programming, teamwork, and communication, and I will work on projects and coursework that will strengthen my interest in applying Python to real-word engineerig problems.
Outside of academics, I will engage in activities that will help me to stay balanced, motivated, and productive.

I wll look forward to opportunities where I can learn, collaborate, and grow, and apply my Python and industrial engineering knowledge in practical situation.
